# Speech Savvy

## Overview

Speech Savvy is an innovative application designed to help individuals with cerebral palsy and neurological conditions and have difficulty in learing speech.

## Background

The majority of individuals with intellectual disabilities, hearing impairment, cerebral palsy, chronic neurological conditions, and speech and language disabilities present with speech sound disorders characterized by unintelligible speech. These errors may reflect a lack of motor skills to produce a sound, a lack of linguistic knowledge, or deficiencies in both. Intervention approaches must focus on one or a combination of both skills. 

Hindi, the national language of India, is spoken by over 1 billion people, and 43% of the Indian population. Speech Savvy aims to address the communication barriers faced by Hindi-speaking individuals with speech sound disorders by providing a reliable and efficient means of translating sign language into spoken Hindi.
